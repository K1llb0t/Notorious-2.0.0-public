# Notorious2.0
it supposed to be a leak but K1llb0t allow me to make it public
and yes its better

Note from K1llb0t_

Reason why i made this client is simple. One day i saw client named Notorious. developed by gerald0mc and few other people. client was really cool so i downloaded it.
But soon after that developers started new project and after that another project and client was left dead.
But sourcecode was public. so i decided i will continue the client and update it*
And also client WILL be getting some updates soon!

*side message to gerald0mc: i asked u if i can code notorious 2.0.0


IF ANYONE WANTS UPDATES GO AND VIST MY REPO ( @K1llb0t )
